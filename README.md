# Simple Language Model Assignment
This assignment allows students to experiment with language models using HuggingFace's libraries. 

1. Students first learned how LLMs work at a high level
2. This assignment tasked them to "fine-tune" a distill gpt2 model
3. It allowed students to realize how little their gpt's knew unless they specified data themselves
